These codes are supplements to the thesis submitted to and approved by the department of Computer Science at Rice University titled "Analyzing robustness of models of chaotic dynamical systems learned from data with Echo state networks"

The folder contains versions of the ESN used to study the dynamics of Lorenz63 and Loren96. It also contains code snippets to generate the datasets used in the study, and some sample plots.

For any questions, reproducibility issues or concerns about anything related to the codes or the results, please refer to the thesis or email me at ma65@rice.edu / mhafez@fci-cu.edu.eg / mohamed.mahmoud.hafez@gmail.com

If you use the paper please cite it, and if you used the code please fork it.
